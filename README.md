 I worked on a project in which I used:HTML,CSS and Javascript.In the HTML part I
had 3 pages:index.html, page1.html, page2.html.The index.html page was the
presentation page, in the other 2 pages I talked about the History of the Romanian
National Football Team and the Golden Generation.In the CSS part I created a css
subfolder,in it the files style1.css, style2.css and we used them to modify the basic
components of the three pages as follows:style1.css - Header will get background
color = #66B032, navigation menu background color =#EBF7E3, main section color
#9BD770, and footer color #375F1B;style2.css - Header will get background color
=#183BF0 , navigation menu background color =#DDE3FD, main section color
#798EF6, and footer color #0A2299. On the JavaScript side I created a javascript
subfolder, in it the scripturi.js file that I used to make the following changes:I
modified the navigation menu common to the three pages organizing it as an
unordered list, arranged We added a button in the header section and the
necessary code so that when the button was pressed the background color of the
main section changed. Using Javascript, when I hover the mouse cursor over one
of the images on the site, that image appears in black and white, and when I exit
the cursor on the image returns to the original colour image. I have added a form
on one of the pages where the user can enter a name and password.
